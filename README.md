# CSB-Project1-2025

This is my repository for the Cyber Security Base Project 1. 

In this repository, there is 5 OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities and their fixes in an web application, wich I created by following this tutorial:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/


# Installation

Follow these instructions to set up the app:

Clone the repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mahlamaki/CSB-Project1-2025.git
```

Navigate to  CSB-Project1-2025/mysite folder.

Start the program:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls to see the web application


There is also http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin, where you can enter the admin site with admin:goodpassword1234
but this is irrelevant for this Project, since all the OWASP vulnerabilities are accessed in /polls.
